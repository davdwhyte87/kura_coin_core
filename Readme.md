 digital payment network for the internet

It is difficult and expensive to get payments 
done over the internet. Imagine you wanted to pay 
a blogger $0.1 for reading a post. We believe that
there is a need for an internet currency. 

We have developed this payment network using rust
and we hope the internet and creatives will adopt
it in their software applications.
